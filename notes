optimize

- let can be faltenned when at first level of blocks
  - except if vars it declares override child ast vars
- do can be faltenned when at first level of blocks
  - except if it uses def


?

- should `def` only be allowed at the top level
  - how would that work with package
  - that would be against giving the full power of js to the user


todo syntax

- cond as primitive
  - no need for if as primitive then, just a small macro
